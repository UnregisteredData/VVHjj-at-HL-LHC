# VVHjj-at-HL-LHC

This is an analysis of the WHjj (W-boson and Higgs boson production in association with jets) process using Monte Carlo simulation data processed with ROOT. The analysis focuses on introducing selection parameters and normalizing the contributions from different signal samples to accurately compare various Klambda values. The goal is to evaluate the significance of the signal over background and optimize the selection cuts for enhanced signal sensitivity. â€‹
