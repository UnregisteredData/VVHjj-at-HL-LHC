# VVHjj-at-HL-LHC

This is an analysis of the new final state WWH (W-boson and Higgs boson production in association with jets) process using Monte Carlo simulation data processed with ROOT to probe the Higgs self-coupling which is not yet measured at CERN's LHC. However, other processes which generate the same final state tend to be produced more often during the collision, which makes the WWH final state due to the Higgs self-coupling very rare. This analysis aims to optimize the selection.â€‹
